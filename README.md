# Code 401 Python Lab 03

## Madlib-CLI

This app takes user input, reads a sample file, and then formats a madlib from the sample file text. That madlib is returned to the user on the Command Line, as well as written into a new file.

I worked with Bionca Bond, Chris Rarig, and Ian Cargill to finish this lab. I did some work on my own to start, and I was able to conceptualize the problem correctly. Ian helped me realize that we needed to use the tests to determine a few of the functions and what they would do. I did have the right idea to access each item with a curly brace, then use the format function to determine how many user inputs there would be. Bionca and Ian then helped with the execution.
